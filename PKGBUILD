# syn-settings — SynapseOS system settings.
pkgname=syn-settings
# pkgver stays 0.1.0 and releases move pkgrel, which is the convention every
# SynapseOS component follows — but here it is a HARD constraint, not a habit:
# build-all.sh writes "$name-0.1.0.tar.gz" and transforms paths to
# "$name-0.1.0/" for every component it builds. Bumping pkgver without changing
# that leaves makepkg looking for a tarball nothing creates.
pkgver=0.1.0
# 30: an AI pane, because AI was reachable from exactly one place — synui's
#   control panel. The installer offers KDE and GNOME, and on either of them
#   there was no way to see whether synapd was running, no way to turn it off,
#   and no way to find out which model it would load. The daemon was still
#   there holding GPU memory; only the switch was missing.
#   ⚠ IT DOES NOT REIMPLEMENT THE SWITCH. Turning the AI off correctly is four
#   closed resurrection paths deep — socket activation, the LAN bridge socket,
#   three separate Wants=, and a reboot — so `off` MASKS synapd.socket and
#   synapd.service and records the choice outside /run. All of that is
#   synui-ai-backend(1), covered by synui's tests/ai_backend_off.sh, and this
#   pane calls it. A second implementation of "off must hold" is a second thing
#   to get wrong, and the first took four attempts.
#   The pane names the SOCKETS as well as the service: a pane that showed only
#   synapd.service would read "inactive" on a machine where the next message
#   anybody sends starts it again.
#   ⚠ The acceleration row is enumerated from the ggml backend libraries in
#   /usr/lib, not from a guessed per-variant directory. The first draft looked
#   for /usr/lib/synapse-llama/cuda and reported "no build found" on a machine
#   running synapse-llama-cuda — the packages install into /usr/bin and
#   /usr/lib and no such directory has ever existed. Same trap power.c
#   documents for the sleep hooks.
# 31: the Network pane's firewall rows say what the firewall IS. They said
#   "ruleset: not read" before, with an honest note that `nft list` needs root
#   — honest and useless: the box HAS a default-drop input firewall and the
#   pane could not say so, which is the same silence that had it believed
#   missing. synnet publishes its state world-readable now, so the rows report
#   the PREFERENCE, the STATE and the SERVICE separately, and the row carries
#   `choice:firewall` — on/off through `pkexec synnet --firewall`, never by
#   writing synnet's files from here.
#   ⚠ ABSENT PREFERENCE MEANS ON, the same rule synnet applies. Reading a
#   missing file as "off" would report an unfiltered machine that is filtered.
#   ⚠ Nothing here reads the kernel: "what synnet believes" is not "what
#   nftables holds", and presenting the first as the second is the claim this
#   area already got wrong once.
# 32: a "container links" row in the Network pane, because the firewall's effect
#   on a container is INVISIBLE and does not look like a firewall. A Waydroid or
#   libvirt guest lives on 192.168.x, which the LAN-trust rule accepts — but the
#   DHCP request that gets it that address is sent from 0.0.0.0, matches no
#   accept, and the default-drop policy eats it. The guest comes up with no
#   network and nothing in any log says firewall, so people go looking at the
#   container, at DNS, at the bridge. The row lists what
#   /etc/synnet/trusted-ifaces names and warns when synnet has not loaded it.
#   ⚠ It reads the FILE, not the published count, so a bridge added but not
#   applied shows as itself rather than as an absence — that mismatch is exactly
#   the state worth reporting, since synnet only rebuilds a chain that has GONE
#   and one that is merely out of date looks healthy to it.
#   ⚠ And a mismatch while the firewall is OFF is not a warning: that is the
#   definition of off, not a fault.
#
# 33 THE MACHINE'S NAME, AND THE LIGHTS.
#
#   ⚠ EVERY SynapseOS install answers to `synapse`. Two of them on one network
#   and Avahi renames one `synapse-2.local`, with no say in which and no
#   promise the suffix survives a reboot — so the .local address stops being a
#   thing anybody can rely on. Renaming was a `hostnamectl` one-liner, which is
#   to say it was not in the settings app at all.
#
#   `set:hostname` on the System pane's identity row, `hostnamectl
#   set-hostname` underneath it. That keeps the design this file has had from
#   the first commit: the write goes through a systemd tool that does its OWN
#   polkit check, and this binary stays not-setuid with no policy of its own.
#
#   ⚠ Validated HERE and more narrowly than sane_value, which allows `/`
#   because most values here are paths. A hostname is letters, digits, hyphen
#   and dot, no leading or trailing punctuation, 63 characters — and refusing
#   it here says what was wrong with what was typed, where refusing it in
#   systemd says "hostnamectl exited 1".
#
#   AND THE RGB LIGHTS. syn-rgb(1) — synui 431 — puts the wallpaper's accent on
#   the RAM, the board and the keyboard. The switch is a row on this pane and a
#   row on synui's control panel, and BOTH run the same command: syn-rgb owns
#   the state file, the systemd path unit and the hardware, so neither door has
#   an opinion of its own to drift.
#
#   ⚠ The row reads rgb.state on every pane load rather than caching it, so
#   `syn-rgb on` typed in a terminal moves it. ⛔ And it is drawn whether
#   openrgb is installed or not — a control that vanishes with its optdepend is
#   a feature nobody finds out about — saying which package to install instead.
# 34: the speech pane — the second door onto the two switches an
#   accessibility user needs first.
#   synui's control panel got them in synui 530; this is the other door, and it
#   is the one that matters on a machine installed with KDE or GNOME, where
#   synui's panel is not there at all. Screen reader, "Answer to its name", the
#   voice and dictation engines this box actually has, speech rate and volume,
#   and the wake words.
#   ⚠ IT REIMPLEMENTS NOTHING. syn-speak(1) owns the announcer and vibe(1) owns
#   the listener; this reads their state files and runs their commands. The AI
#   pane's rule, for the same reason.
#   ⛔ THE WAKE ROW READS assistant.state, NOT `systemctl is-active`. A unit can
#   be active with its listener failing to open the device, and the question
#   this row answers is whether a MICROPHONE IS OPEN. synui's bar indicator and
#   its control panel row read the same file — one fact, three surfaces.
#   ⛔ AND A DEAD BUTTON WAS FOUND BY TESTING THE ROW'S OWN ADVICE. `wake-words`
#   is the one value in this app that legally contains commas, and set()'s
#   generic sane_value() gate rejects a comma before any key is looked at — so
#   the row offered a comma-separated list and refused every comma. Lifted
#   above the gate with a validator of its own (letters, commas, spaces);
#   loosening sane_value would have weakened it for the thirty keys that DO
#   exec. The test now sets each key to the value its own help text suggests,
#   which is the check that would have caught it.
# 42: the Speech pane shows the unit behind the reader, not just the switch.
#   ⛔ A SWITCH AND THE THING IT SWITCHES ARE TWO SEPARATE FACTS. This pane
#   listed vibe-wake.service — the listener — and nothing for the announcer,
#   which is precisely where the gap was: syn-speak.service was missing from the
#   synui package for four releases (synui 564 ships it), `syn-speak on` enabled
#   a unit that was not there, the failure was swallowed on purpose so that a
#   machine without systemd is not a broken install, and the Screen reader
#   switch here reported On with nothing behind it. A row reading "not
#   installed" beside a switch reading "on" is the sentence that would have said
#   so; both units are listed now, reader first, matching the switches above.
#   ⛔ AND "not-found" IS THE ANSWER THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS. The old inline
#   lookup fell back to "not installed" only on EMPTY output — which comes from
#   an older systemd or from systemctl failing outright — while systemd prints
#   "not-found" for `is-enabled` on a unit it does not have. Both spellings are
#   translated now, in a shared user_unit_state() the wake row uses too; the
#   same trap ai.c documents in unit_absent(), and the reason this one is
#   --user: everything on this pane is a session service.

# ── Where the source comes from, here and everywhere else ──────────────────
#
# ⛔ ONE source LINE SERVES BOTH, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. build-all.sh runs
# tools/collect-source.sh, which drops $pkgname-$pkgver.tar.gz beside this file;
# makepkg finds it (`-> Found ...`) and never touches the URL. Anybody WITHOUT
# this checkout has no such file, so makepkg fetches the identical tarball from
# the release that carries this exact pkgver-pkgrel. A second PKGBUILD for
# outside use would be a second set of depends and install rules, free to drift
# from this one — and the person it broke for could not see this file at all.
#
# ⚠ ITS OWN REPOSITORY, NOT THIS ONE. The source release lives at
# github.com/velle999/$pkgname — which is also where the PKGBUILD is published
# as a clonable package repo — because putting them on SYNAPSE's releases page
# buried the ISO downloads under a component tarball per bump, and made the
# newest of those GitHub's "Latest release" for the whole project.
#
# ⚠ THE TAG CARRIES THE pkgrel, so the URL cannot point at the wrong source.
# preflight.sh already refuses a source edit that does not bump pkgrel, which
# means every change to what gets built moves this URL with it.
#
# ⛔ AND sha256sums STAYS 'SKIP'. A real checksum would break every LOCAL build
# the moment somebody edited a source file, because the tarball beside this file
# is regenerated from the working tree and would no longer match. The published
# asset is reproducible instead — collect-source.sh sorts and zeroes the
# timestamps, so `tools/collect-source.sh <name>` at the tagged commit
# re-derives it byte for byte. packaging/README.md has the whole of it.
